This is a short experiment to connect BART's estimated arrivals feed
(http://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/etas.aspx) to a Twilio-run phone
number via SMS.

Twilio sends the body of each SMS as a postvar, "Body", but it's also possible
to use the URL parameter "q" for testing, e.g.:

    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=powell
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=16th+mission
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=19th
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=berkeley
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=airport
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=SFO
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=OAK
    http://teczno.com/SMS2BART4ETA/?q=dub

Try queries that match parts of station names, such as characteristic words
or beginnings of words.

For the moment, I've connected this service to the phone number (510) 692-9295.
Try text messages consisting only of station queries like the examples above.
